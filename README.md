# LeNet-5 Model in TensorFlow

This is a simple implementation of the LeNet-5 architecture for image classification using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Overview

LeNet-5 is a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture proposed by Yann LeCun for handwritten digit recognition. The network consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to classify images into one of the 10 possible digits.

This implementation uses TensorFlow 2.x and Keras for building and training the model.


## Requirements
**I trained and saved the best model, you can simply load the model and do predictions, in Jupyter notebook!**

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `tensorflow==2.x`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations, if needed)

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
